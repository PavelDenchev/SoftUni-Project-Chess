        <h3 class="glossary-term">Absolute pin</h3>
        <p class="glossary-term-desciption">A <a href="#pin">pin</a> against the king is called absolute since the
            pinned piece cannot legally move out of the line of attack (as moving it would expose the king to check).

        <h3 class="glossary-term">Advanced pawn</h3>
        <p class="glossary-term-desciption">A pawn that is on the opponent's side of the board (the fifth rank or higher
            for white and fourth rank or lower for black). An advanced pawn may be weak if it is overextended, lacking
            support and difficult to defend, or strong if it cramps the enemy by limiting mobility. An advanced <a
                href="#passed-pawn">passed pawn</a> that threatens to <a href="#promotion">promote</a> can be especially

        <p class="glossary-term-desciption">A game that is guaranteed to produce a decisive result, because if there is
            a draw it is ruled a victory for Black. In compensation for this White is given more time on the clock.
            Often White is given six minutes, and Black five. This format is typically used in playoff tiebreakers when
            shorter blitz games have not resolved the tie.</p>

        <p class="glossary-term-desciption">A <a href="#checkmate">checkmate</a> delivered by a rook or queen along a
            back rank from which the
            mated king is unable to move because it is blocked by friendly pieces (usually pawns) on the second rank.
        </p>
        <h3 class="glossary-term">Backward pawn</h3>
        <p class="glossary-term-desciption">A pawn that is potentially weak because it's behind pawns on adjacent files

            to an arrangement of two pieces in line with the enemy king on a rank, file, or diagonal so that if the
