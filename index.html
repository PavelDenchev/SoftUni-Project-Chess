        <div class="players-description carlsen-description">
            <p>Sven Magnus Øen Carlsen (born 30 November 1990) is a Norwegian chess grandmaster and the current World
                Chess Champion. He is a two-time World Rapid Chess Champion and four-time World Blitz Chess Champion.
                Carlsen first reached the top of the FIDE world rankings in 2010, and trails only Garry Kasparov at time
                spent as world number one. His peak classical rating of 2882, achieved in 2014, is the highest in
                history. A chess prodigy, Carlsen tied for first place in the World U12 Chess Championship in 2002.
                Shortly after turning 13, he finished first in the C group of the Corus chess tournament, and earned the
                grandmaster title a few months later. At age 15, he won the Norwegian Chess Championship, and at 17, he
                finished joint first in the top group of Corus. He surpassed a rating of 2800 at age 18 and reached
                number one in the FIDE world rankings aged 19, becoming the youngest person ever to achieve those feats.
                Carlsen became World Champion in 2013 by defeating Viswanathan Anand. In the following year, he retained
                his title against Anand, and won both the 2014 World Rapid Championship and World Blitz Championship,
                thus becoming the first player to simultaneously hold all three titles. He defended his main world title
                against Sergey Karjakin in 2016, and against Fabiano Caruana in 2018.</p>

        <div class="players-description kasparov-description">
            <p>Garry Kimovich Kasparov (born 13 April 1963) is a Russian chess grandmaster, former world chess champion,
                writer, and political activist, whom many consider to be the greatest chess player of all time. From
                1986 until his retirement in 2005, Kasparov was ranked world No. 1 for 225 out of 228 months. His peak
                rating of 2851, achieved in 1999, was the highest recorded until being surpassed by Magnus Carlsen in
                2013. Kasparov also holds records for consecutive professional tournament victories (15) and Chess
                Oscars (11). Kasparov became the youngest ever undisputed World Chess Champion in 1985 at age 22 by
                defeating then-champion Anatoly Karpov. He held the official FIDE world title until 1993, when a dispute
                with FIDE led him to set up a rival organization, the Professional Chess Association. In 1997 he became
                the first world champion to lose a match to a computer under standard time controls, when he lost to the
                IBM supercomputer Deep Blue in a highly publicized match. He continued to hold the "Classical" World
                Chess Championship until his defeat by Vladimir Kramnik in 2000.</p>

            <p>Fabiano Luigi Caruana (born July 30, 1992) is an Italian-American chess grandmaster. A chess prodigy, he
                became a grandmaster at the age of 14 years, 11 months and 20 days—the youngest grandmaster in the
                history of both Italy and the United States at the time. Born in Miami to Italian-American parents,
                Caruana grew up in Park Slope, Brooklyn. He played for the United States until 2005, when he transferred
                to Italy. He earned his grandmaster title in 2007, and in the same year won his first Italian Chess
                Championship, a feat he repeated in 2008, 2010 and 2011. He won the Dortmund Sparkassen Chess Meeting in
                2012, 2014 and 2015. He also won the Sinquefield Cup 2014, recording a historic 3103 performance rating
                and improving his Elo rating to 2844, becoming the third-highest-rated player in history. He transferred
                back to the US in 2015. Having won the FIDE Grand Prix 2014–15, Caruana qualified for the Candidates
                Tournament 2016, where he was runner-up to Sergey Karjakin. He won the 2016 US Chess Championship, and
                represented the US on board 1 at the 42nd Chess Olympiad, winning team gold and individual bronze.</p>
