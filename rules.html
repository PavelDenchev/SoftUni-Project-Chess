        <p class="rules-content">At the beginning of the game the board is laid out so that each player has the
            light color square in the bottom right side. The chess pieces are then arranged the same way each time.
            The second row (or rank) is filled with pawns. The rooks go in the corners, then the knights next to
            them, followed by the bishops, and finally the queen, who always goes on her own matching color (white
            queen on light, black queen on dark), and the king on the remaining square.</p>
