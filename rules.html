    <h1 class="rules-title">Setting up the board</h1>
    <p class="rules-content">At the beginning of the game the board is laid out so that each player has the
        light color square in the bottom right side. The chess pieces are then arranged the same way each time.
        The second row (or rank) is filled with pawns. The rooks go in the corners, then the knights next to
        them, followed by the bishops, and finally the queen, who always goes on her own matching color (white
        queen on light, black queen on dark), and the king on the remaining square.</p>

    <div class="moves">
        <h1 class="rules-title">Moving the pieces</h1>
        <p class="rules-content">Each of the different kinds of pieces move in a different way. Pieces cannot move
            through
            other pieces (with the exception of the knight), and can never move onto a square with one of their own
            pieces.
            However, they can be moved to take the place of an opponent's piece which is then removed from play (this is
            known as capturing).</p>

        <h1 class="rules-title">King moves</h1>
        <p class="rules-content">The king is the most important piece, but he is very weak. He can only move one square
            in any direction - up, down, to the sides, and diagonally. The king may never move himself into check (where he
            could be captured). When the king is attacked by another piece this is called "check".</p>

        </div>

        <h1 class="rules-title">Queen moves</h1>
        <p class="rules-content">The queen is the most powerful piece. She can move any number of vacant squares in any one straight direction - forward, backward, sideways, or diagonally. With the exception of the king the queen is the most valuable piece. She is worth 9 points.</p>

        <div class="chessboard">
            {% include chessboard.html %}
            <img src="./images/white-queen.png" class="piece moves-queen">
        </div>

        <h1 class="rules-title">Rook moves</h1>
        <p class="rules-content">The rook is the second most powerful piece. It can move any number of vacant squares in a horizontal or vertical direction. They are very powerful when they protect each other. Rooks are worth 5 points each.</p>

        <div class="chessboard">
            {% include chessboard.html %}
            <img src="./images/white-rook.png" class="piece moves-rook">
        </div>

        <h1 class="rules-title">Bishop moves</h1>
        <p class="rules-content">The bishop moves any number of vacant squares in any diagonal direction. Each bishop starts on one color (light or dark) and must always stay on that color. Bishops work well together because they cover up each other's weaknesses. Bishops are worth 3 points each.</p>

        <div class="chessboard">
            {% include chessboard.html %}
            <img src="./images/white-bishop.png" class="piece moves-bishop">
        </div>

        <h1 class="rules-title">Knight moves</h1>
        <p class="rules-content">The knight moves to the nearest square not on the same rank, file, or diagonal. (This can be thought of as moving two squares horizontally then one square vertically, or moving one square horizontally then two squares verticallyâ€”i.e. in an "L" pattern.) The knight is not blocked by other pieces: it jumps to the new location. Knights are worth 3 points each.</p>

        </div>

        <h1 class="rules-title">Pawn moves</h1>
        <p class="rules-content">Pawns have the most complex rules of movement. A pawn moves straight forward one square, if that square is vacant. If it has not yet moved, a pawn also has the option of moving two squares straight forward, provided both squares are vacant. Pawns cannot move backwards. Pawns are the only pieces that capture differently from how they move. A pawn can capture an enemy piece on either of the two squares diagonally in front of the pawn (but cannot move to those squares if they are vacant). Pawns are worth 1 point each.</p>

        <h1 class="rules-main-title">Special rules</h1>
        <h1 class="rules-title">Castling</h1>
        <p class="rules-content">Castling consists of moving the king two squares towards a rook, then placing the rook on the other side of the king, adjacent to it. Castling is only allowed when the king and rook involved in castling have ot been previously moved, there are no pieces between the king and the rook and the king may not currently be in check, nor may the king pass through or end up in a square that is under attack by an enemy piece (though the rook is permitted to be under attack and to pass over an attacked square).</p>

        <div class="chessboard">
            {% include chessboard.html %}
            <img src="./images/white-rook.png" class="piece castling castling-white-rook">

        </div>

        <h1 class="rules-title">Promoting a pawn</h1>
        <p class="rules-content">If a player advances a pawn to its eighth rank, the pawn is then promoted (converted) to a queen, rook, bishop, or knight of the same color at the choice of the player (a queen is usually chosen). The choice is not limited to previously captured pieces. Hence it is theoretically possible for a player to have up to nine queens or up to ten rooks, bishops, or knights if all of their pawns are promoted. Only pawns may be promoted.</p>

        <div class="chessboard">
            {% include chessboard.html %}

            <img src="./images/white-queen.png" class="piece promotion promotion-queen">
        </div>

        <h1 class="rules-title">En passant</h1>
        <p class="rules-content">When a pawn advances two squares from its original square and ends the turn adjacent to a pawn of the opponent's on the same rank, it may be captured by that pawn of the opponent's, as if it had moved only one square forward. This capture is only legal on the opponent's next move immediately following the first pawn's advance. This is known as "en passant" (French for "in passing"). The illustration below shows an instance of this.</p>
