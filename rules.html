    <h1 class="rules-title">Setting up the board</h1>
    <p class="rules-content">At the beginning of the game the board is laid out so that each player has the
        light color square in the bottom right side. The chess pieces are then arranged the same way each time.
        The second row (or rank) is filled with pawns. The rooks go in the corners, then the knights next to
        them, followed by the bishops, and finally the queen, who always goes on her own matching color (white
        queen on light, black queen on dark), and the king on the remaining square.</p>

        <h1 class="rules-title">Moving the pieces</h1>
        <p class="rules-content">Each of the different kinds of pieces move in a different way. Pieces cannot move
            through
            other pieces (with the exception of the knight), and can never move onto a square with one of their own
            pieces.
            However, they can be moved to take the place of an opponent's piece which is then removed from play (this is
            known as capturing).</p>

        <h1 class="rules-title">King moves</h1>
        <p class="rules-content">The king is the most important piece, but he is very weak. He can only move one square
            in any direction - up, down, to the sides, and diagonally. The king may never move himself into check (where he
            could be captured). When the king is attacked by another piece this is called "check".</p>

        <h1 class="rules-title">Queen moves</h1>
        <p class="rules-content">The queen is the most powerful piece. She can move any number of vacant squares in any one straight direction - forward, backward, sideways, or diagonally. With the exception of the king the queen is the most valuable piece. She is worth 9 points.</p>

        <h1 class="rules-title">Rook moves</h1>
        <p class="rules-content">The rook is the second most powerful piece. It can move any number of vacant squares in a horizontal or vertical direction. Rooks are valued at 5 points.</p>
